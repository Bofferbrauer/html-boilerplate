            Hello everyone,
      </p>

      <p>
            My name is Steve Weidig, I'm from Luxembourg, I'm 39 years old and I'm training to become a web developer.
      </p>

      <p>
            Web development and coding in general has been a long-time passion for me, and I'm finally at a point where I hope to make my passion also my job, and I'm very excited about that prospect.
      </p>
